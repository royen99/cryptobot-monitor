## Installation

### Prerequisites
Since this monitor should work with the Cryptobot-trader, you need to have the trading bot set up and running. Follow the instructions in the [Trader](https://github.com/royen99/cryptobot-trader) repository to get it up and running.

Use the supplied config.json.template file for your database connection settings, and other configurations. \
Make sure to rename it to `config.json` and fill in your details and place it in the appropriate directory (.env by default). 

The `config.json` file uses the exact same format as the Cryptobot-trader (you can also use the same docker volume).

The provided sample Docker Compose file (`docker-compose-sample.yml`) can be used as a starting point. Adjust the configuration as needed for your environment. \
It is also setup to start both the monitor and trader services (modify as needed).

## The easy podman way (Ubuntu)

### Install Podman and Podman Compose:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y podman podman-compose
   ```

### Setup config files
Create a directory for your environment files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p cryptotrader && cd cryptotrader
   mkdir -p .env
   ```
Create a `config.json` file in the `.env` directory and fill in your details. You can use the `config.json.template` file as a reference.

If you're starting fresh, ensure that the `init.sql` file is also in your current directory.

### Use the Podman Compose file to start the services:
Note that the `docker-compose-sample.yml` file is compatible with Podman Compose, so you can use it directly and is setup to start all the necessary services (db, trader, monitor) in one go.

   ```bash
   podman-compose -f docker-compose-sample.yml up -d
   ```

### Verify the services are running:
   ```bash
   podman ps
   CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                     COMMAND               CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                   NAMES
   b1b73c377c8e  postgres:15-alpine        postgres              11 seconds ago  Up 11 seconds  0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp  db_1
   ed6f6678fbbc  cryptobot-trader:latest   python app/main.p...  8 seconds ago   Up 8 seconds                           trader_1
   7d65ae95c99f  cryptobot-monitor:latest  uvicorn app.main:...  6 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp  monitor_1
   ```

To access the Dashboard, you can access the monitor's web interface at `http://localhost:8080`.

Following up on the trading bot's output, use podman's log option:

```bash
podman logs -f trader_1
